# GetConnectorDimension

This script reports the number of points contained in the connectors selected
by the user.

**NOTE: It turns out that the exact objective of this script is achievable by
selecting the target connectors and using the "Grid Cell Count" function
provided by Pointwise (_Grid->Cell Count_).** This, however, may be quicker and
a little more consise.
